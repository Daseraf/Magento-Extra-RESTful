# Product Reviews

## Create

- `POST /api/rest/products/:product/reviews`
- `POST /api/rest/products/:product/reviews/store/:store`

Guests can only create reviews if enabled in _System > Configuration > Catalog > Product Reviews_.
Customer may always create reviews.
New reviews are created with a "Pending" status.

### Attributes

- `detail`: The content of the post.
- `nickname`: User supplied name.  Not restricted to customer name.
- `ratings`: Object where keys are printable labels and values are percentages.
- `title`: A summary of the post.

### Example

```http
POST /api/rest/products/555/reviews HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 119
Content-Type: application/json
Host: example.com

{
    "detail": "This is a review",
    "nickname": "Ted",
    "ratings": {
        "Price": 100,
        "Quality": 25
    },
    "title": "This is a title"
}
```

The ratings' percentage will be rounded up to the next multiple of 20 because Magento is written to always use five stars.

## Update

- `PUT /api/rest/reviews/:id`

Only admin users may access this method.
The common use is to approve reviews that are currently pending.
A client only needs to specify the fields to change.
In this respect it is more like a `PATCH` request but Magento's API does not accept that so a `PUT` is used instead.

### Attributes

- `customer_id`: Assigning an anonymous review to a customer is possible. Reassigning from a known customer is not advised, Magento admin does not allow it.
- `detail`: The content of the post.
- `nickname`: User supplied name.  Not restricted to customer name.
- `ratings`: Object where keys are printable labels and values are percentages.
- `status`: One of "Pending", "Approved", "Not Approved".
- `stores`: Array of store IDs where this review has been enabled.
- `title`: A summary of the post.

### Example

```http
PUT /api/rest/reviews/99 HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 22
Content-Type: application/json
Host: example.com

{
    "status": "Approved"
}
```

## Delete

- `DELETE /api/rest/reviews/:id`

Customers cannot delete their own reviews.

# Categories

## Retrieve

- `GET /api/rest/categories`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/store/:store`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/:id`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/:id/store/:store`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/:id/children`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/:id/children/store/:store`
- `GET /api/rest/category_trees`
- `GET /api/rest/category_trees/store/:store`

Results are filtered by `:store`.
If omitted by guests or customers the default store is assumed.
If omitted by admin users all categories are accessible, even if they are not assigned to any store.
Only admin users may see inactive categories.

A category's "children" are it's immediate child categories.
For a category's products see [below](#category-products).

The `category_trees` resource is a special representation where only root categories are listed but each has a `children` field which is an embedded list of categories,
each of those may also have a `children` field and so on…
There is no paging nor sorting.
Child categories are already in `position` order.
Since guests and customers may only see categories relevant to their store,
and a store only has one root category,
then they will always retrieve one tree.
This resource is intended for fetching all categories in one request and so for very large sites might be slow and/or have memory limit problems.

### Category Products

A category's products are already available from `/api/rest/products/category/:category` but this ignores anchor categories with child categories.
The preferred alternative is the following resources which accurately match the `product_count` of an anchor category.

- `GET /api/rest/categories/:category/products`
- `GET /api/rest/categories/:category/products/store/:store`

The product records returned are Extra RESTful products.
See [docs/Products.md](https://github.com/clockworkgeek/Magento-Extra-RESTful/blob/master/docs/Products.md) for more information.

## Create / Update

- `POST /api/rest/categories/` - Add Root Category
- `POST /api/rest/categories/:id/children` - Add Subcategory
- `PUT /api/rest/categories/:id`
- `PUT /api/rest/categories/:id/store/:store`

Admin only.

Changing either the `parent_id` or `url_key` can affect the URL rewrite rule(s) for the category being altered.
This API has no equivalent for the "Create Permanent Redirect for old URL" option seen in admin.
Instead, an API client should explicitly [create a URL redirect](https://github.com/clockworkgeek/Magento-Extra-RESTful/blob/master/docs/URLRewrites.md#create--update) for each store.
Products' URLs may also be affected so an API client might [query all URL rewrites](https://github.com/clockworkgeek/Magento-Extra-RESTful/blob/master/docs/URLRewrites.md#retrieve) containg the category ID before making a change,
then inspect them all afterwards and make permanent redirects appropriately.
